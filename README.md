#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the designing, developing, testing and maintaining software systems. It is very important in the technology
industy because:
Without software engineering, we wouldn't have many of the amazing technologies we use today, like smartphones, social media, and online banking.
It also helps businesses run more efficiently, like inventory management systems that help companies keep track of their stock.
Plus, software engineering is a huge job market, with many companies looking for skilled engineers to develop and maintain their software systems.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

Milestone 1: The Birth of Software Engineering (1960s)
In the 1960s, software development was still a relatively new field, and it was often seen as a subset of computer science. However, as computers became more widespread and software systems grew in complexity, it became clear that a more systematic approach was needed. The term "software engineering" was first coined in 1968 by Margaret Hamilton, a computer scientist and systems engineer, to describe the application of engineering principles to software development.

Milestone 2: The Waterfall Model and Structured Analysis (1970s-1980s)
In the 1970s and 1980s, software engineering began to take shape as a more formalized discipline. The Waterfall Model, developed by Winston Royce in 1970, introduced a linear and sequential approach to software development, where each phase (requirements, design, implementation, testing, and maintenance) was completed before moving on to the next one.

Milestone 3: Agile Development and Iterative Approaches (1990s-2000s)
In the 1990s and 2000s, the software engineering landscape underwent a significant shift with the emergence of agile development methodologies, such as Scrum and Extreme Programming (XP). 


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Planning Phase

Where we define project scope, goals, and deliverables

2. Requirements Gathering Phase

This is where we collect and document user requirements through surveys, interviews, and workshops

3. Analysis Phase

Break down high-level requirements into smaller, more detailed components

4. Design Phase

We create a detailed design of the system, including architecture, components, and interfaces

5. Implementation (Coding) Phase

Write the code for the system, using the design specifications as a guide

6. Testing Phase

Develop and execute test plans and test cases
Fix defects and bugs, and re-test the system

7. Deployment Phase

Plan and prepare for the deployment of the system
Install and configure the system in the production environment

8. Maintenance Phase

Fix defects and bugs that are reported by end-users


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall Methodology

Characteristics:

Linear and sequential approach
Phases are completed one after the other, with no overlap
Requirements are gathered at the beginning and frozen
No changes are allowed once the project is underway
Testing is done at the end of the project
Emphasis on predictability and stability
Advantages:

Easy to manage and understand
Clear timelines and deadlines
Suitable for small, simple projects with well-defined requirements
Less overhead in terms of process and documentation
Disadvantages:

Inflexible and resistant to change
High risk if requirements are not well-defined or change during the project
Testing is done late in the project, which can lead to costly rework
Not suitable for complex or iterative projects
Scenarios where Waterfall is appropriate in Kenya:

Developing a simple e-commerce website for a small business, where the requirements are well-defined and unlikely to change.
Creating a mobile app for a specific, well-defined purpose, such as a bus ticketing system.
Implementing a standardized, off-the-shelf software solution, such as an accounting system.
Agile Methodology

Characteristics:

Iterative and incremental approach
Phases are completed in short cycles (sprints) with continuous feedback and improvement
Requirements are gathered and refined throughout the project
Changes are allowed and encouraged throughout the project
Testing is done continuously throughout the project
Emphasis on flexibility and adaptability
Advantages:

Flexible and adaptable to changing requirements
Fast time-to-market and rapid delivery of working software
Encourages collaboration and communication among team members and stakeholders
Suitable for complex, iterative, or uncertain projects
Disadvantages:

Can be chaotic and difficult to manage if not implemented correctly
Requires significant overhead in terms of process and documentation
Can be challenging to estimate timelines and budgets

Scenarios where Agile is appropriate:

Developing a complex, custom software solution for a large enterprise, where requirements are likely to change during the project.
Creating a mobile app for a startup, where the requirements are uncertain and likely to evolve during development.
Implementing a digital transformation project for a government agency, where the requirements are complex and iterative.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software Developer:

Writes code to create software applications
Fixes bugs and makes improvements to existing code
Works with others to design and build new features

Quality Assurance Engineer:

Tests software to find bugs and errors
Makes sure software works as expected
Reports problems to developers to fix

Project Manager:

Oversees the entire software project
Makes sure project is on track and on time
Coordinates team members and resources

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

Integrated Development Environments (IDEs):

Is a software application that provides a comprehensive set of tools for coding, debugging, and testing eg; Visual Sthudio Code

Version Control Systems (VCS):

A system that helps track changes to code over time
Allows multiple developers to collaborate on a project ie; GIT

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Challenge 1: Debugging and Troubleshooting. Difficulty finding and fixing errors in code.
Strategy:
        Use debugging tools and techniques (e.g., print statements, breakpoints)
        Break down complex problems into smaller, manageable parts

Challenge 2: Meeting Deadlines and Managing Time. Difficulty completing tasks on time and managing workload
Strategy:
        Prioritize tasks and focus on high-impact activities
        Break down large tasks into smaller, manageable chunks

 Challenge 3: Staying Up-to-Date with New Technologies. Difficulty keeping up with rapidly changing technologies and trends
Strategy:
      Set aside time for learning and professional development
      Follow industry leaders and blogs to stay informed
      Participate in online communities and forums to learn from others


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit Testing
Focuses on individual units of code, such as functions or methods
Verifies that each unit works as expected in isolation
Importance: Ensures that individual components of the software are correct and function as intended.

Integration Testing
Focuses on how individual units work together
Verifies that components interact correctly and produce the expected results
Importance: Ensures that components integrate seamlessly and produce the desired output
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt Enginnering is the type of software engineering where you give or interact with AI chatbox or AI model by giving a very accurate and concise prompt to expect a well defined output. Importance include;
Improved responce
Increased Efficiency
Tilme saving
Enables better decision making

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague Prompt: "What can I do to help in my community?"

This prompt is vague because it:

Doesn't specify what kind of help is needed
Doesn't define what "community" means (e.g., local neighborhood, school, or online community)
Is too broad and open-ended

Improved Prompt: "What are some ways I can volunteer to improve education for primary school students in Kiambiu Slum?"

This improved prompt is more effective because it:

Specifies the goal: Improving education for primary school students  in Kiambiu
Defines the scope: Kiambiu
Identifies the action: Volunteering (specific way to help)
Is concise: Easy to understand and focused on a specific issue
